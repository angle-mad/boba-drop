    <p>A calico cat is a domestic cat of any breed with a tri-color coat.
        The calico cat is most commonly thought of as being 25% to 75% white with large orange and black patches;
        however, they may have other colors in their patterns.
        Calico cats are almost exclusively female except under rare genetic conditions.
        A calico cat is not to be confused with a tortoiseshell, which has a black undercoat and a mostly mottled coat
        of black/red or blue/cream with relatively few to no white markings. </p>
